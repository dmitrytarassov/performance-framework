# Performance Test: for vs reduce vs forEach

This test aims to compare the performance of three different JavaScript methods for iterating over arrays: `for`, `reduce`, and `forEach`. The test measures the time taken by each method to sum up the elements of an array.

## Test Files

The test is organized into three separate files, each containing the implementation for one of the methods:

- [1-for-of.js](1-for-of.js)
- [2-for-classic.js](2-for-classic.js)
- [3-forEach.js](3-forEach.js)
- [4-reduce-instant-function-declaration.js](4-reduce-instant-function-declaration.js)
- [5-reduce-instant-arrow-function.js](5-reduce-instant-arrow-function.js)
- [6-reduce-created-function-declaration.js](6-reduce-created-function-declaration.js)
- [7-reduce-created-arrow-function.js](7-reduce-created-arrow-function.js)
